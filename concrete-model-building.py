        # **ConCReTE: City of Pittsburgh Module**
        ---
        ## **The Story So Far**
        The City of Pittsburgh is implementing a three-year data strategy under the leadership of Chris Belasco, Senior Manager of Digital Services and Chief Data Officer. This strategy positions data as a critical asset to enhance city operations, engage the community, and drive equity. The city focuses on improving data accessibility and quality while fostering a culture of insight-driven decision-making. Participants in this initiative are tasked with analyzing and forecasting the city’s revenue, which is critical for supporting Pittsburgh’s long-term goals. Prior to the start of this scenario, Chris's team has:

        1. Identified a need to forecast the city's revenue.
        2. Reviewed historical revenue data and identfied the specific tables needed in the City's Revenue Report PDfs; namely, the Q4 Revenue Summary Table from each report and the Quarterly Revenue Totals (Actual, not projected) from each table.
        3. Downloaded the Revenue Report PDFs and extracted the Q4 Revenue Summary Tables into separate documents.
        4. Used six different methodologies to extract the actual quarterly revenue totals from each PDF table.
            - Manual Extraction by a Human
            - Automated Extraction with Docling
            - Automated Extraction with One-Shot AI ChatBot (Claude & ChatGPT)
            - Automated Extraction Claude API (PDF & Images)
            - Automated Extraction with pypdf

        ### Role
        You are an intern working for Chris, and he has asked you to help out with this next stage of the project.

        ### Business Objective
        You want to use the historical quarterly revenue data to create a predictive model for the city's revenue.
        Beyond creating an accurate predictive model, you will need to consider what the most appropriate way to approach parsing the data is.

        ### Data
        We have a dataset of the city's quarterly revenue from 2012 to 2023.
